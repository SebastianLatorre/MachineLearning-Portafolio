La diferencia en el MSE entre entrenamiento y prueba también es pequeña, sugiriendo una buena capacidad de generalización.\n","\n","\n","**Comentario final**\n","\n","*   Los resultados sugieren que LinUCB es el mejor algoritmo de los tres evaluados, mostrando el menor MSE en ambos conjuntos de datos. Esto sugiere que LinUCB es el más efectivo en la predicción de las calificaciones en comparación con EpsilonGreedy y UCB1. La capacidad de generalización de LinUCB también parece ser muy buena, ya que el MSE en el conjunto de prueba es muy similar al del conjunto de entrenamiento.\n","\n","*   EpsilonGreedy sigue siendo una opción importante, con un rendimiento muy cercano a LinUCB, pero con un MSE ligeramente mayor. UCB1, aunque es útil, parece ser menos eficiente en comparación con los otros dos algoritmos para este conjunto de datos específico.\n","\n","*   En general, LinUCB podría ser preferible en escenarios donde la precisión en la predicción es crucial, mientras que EpsilonGreedy podría ser una opción más simple si la precisión no es tan crítica."],"metadata":{"id":"dhO-ruHkAySX"}}]}
